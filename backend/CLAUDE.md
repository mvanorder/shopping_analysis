# CLAUDE.md (backend)

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in `backend/`.

## Project overview

FastAPI backend for the _Shopping Analysis_ project. It exposes
HTTP endpoints for uploading/inspecting order data and persists to Postgres
via SQLAlchemy's async engine, with Alembic managing schema migrations.

- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app and route handlers.
- `app/config.py` — `Settings` (pydantic-settings) for Postgres connection
  config, loaded from `backend/.env` (see `.env.example`) or environment
  variables.
- `app/db.py` — async engine/session setup (`get_engine`, `get_sessionmaker`,
  `get_db`) and the declarative `Base` for ORM models.
- `alembic/`, `alembic.ini` — migrations; `alembic/env.py` builds the DB URL
  from `app.config.Settings` rather than `alembic.ini`'s `sqlalchemy.url`.

## Running

From `backend/`, with the venv active:

- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` — run the dev server.
- `alembic upgrade head` — apply migrations.
- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<message>"` — generate a migration.
- `python -m app.cli create-superuser --email <email>` — create (or promote) a superuser.
  `--email` is prompted for interactively if omitted (and required as a flag when there's no
  terminal). Reads the initial password from `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` or `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD_FILE`;
  with neither set it prompts for the password (twice, to confirm) when run at a terminal.
  Submitting an empty password — or, in non-interactive automation, leaving both env vars unset —
  bootstraps a Google-OAuth-only account instead (see `docs/design/uac-design.md` §2). Safe to
  re-run — it promotes an existing account rather than duplicating it.

## Docstring conventions

- **Every** Python class and function/method — public or private — must have
  a docstring. At minimum, a one-line summary of its purpose; no exceptions
  for "obvious" or trivial ones.
- **Every** module (`.py` file) must also have a one-line module-level
  docstring as its first statement, e.g. `"""Async SQLAlchemy engine/session
  setup and the declarative ORM base."""` at the top of `app/db.py`.
- Use **reST style** for docstrings (`:param:`, `:type:`, `:returns:`,
  `:rtype:`, `:raises:`), e.g.:

  ```python
  def get_settings() -> Settings:
      """Return the cached application settings singleton.

      :returns: The process-wide ``Settings`` instance.
      :rtype: Settings
      """
  ```

  ```python
  async def upload_orders_csv(file: UploadFile) -> dict:
      """Parse an uploaded Walmart order-history CSV and echo its rows.

      :param file: The uploaded CSV file.
      :type file: UploadFile
      :raises HTTPException: If the file is missing, not a ``.csv``, not
          valid UTF-8, or has no header row.
      :returns: The filename, column names, row count, and parsed rows.
      :rtype: dict
      """
  ```

- Omit a `:param:`/`:returns:`/`:raises:` line only when it doesn't apply
  (e.g. no parameters, no meaningful return value) — don't pad docstrings
  with empty sections.
- FastAPI route docstrings still need `:param:`/`:returns:`/`:raises:` where
  applicable, in addition to serving as the OpenAPI summary.
