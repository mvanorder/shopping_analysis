# UAC Design — User Management, Access Control & Deployment

Status: draft, for review. Partially implemented: most of §5's schema (`users`,
`auth_identities`, `refresh_tokens`, `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_roles`,
`audit_log`) exists as an ORM model + migration, and the container/compose scaffolding (§6–§8) is
built. `orders`/`order_items` are deliberately excluded pending plan refinement (see §5). The
`create-superuser` bootstrap CLI (§2) is built, including argon2 password hashing. The rest of
the *behavior* on top of the built schema is not there yet: password verification at login, JWT
issuance, RBAC enforcement (§3), and the Google OAuth flow (§4) are all still design-only.
Scope: user accounts, authentication, authorization (RBAC), and the container/deployment
architecture needed to run this at anywhere from single-user to millions-of-users scale.

This builds on prior decisions: Postgres + SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) as the ORM layer, FastAPI
backend, stateless API instances so the app can scale horizontally.

## 1. User management

### Identity model

A user's login identity is kept separate from *how* they authenticate, so one account can have
a password, a Google login, or both, without schema changes later:

- **`users`** — the account itself. `id` (UUID), `email` (unique, citext), `display_name`,
  `avatar_url`, `is_active`, `email_verified`, `is_superuser`, `created_at`, `updated_at`,
  `last_login_at`. No password column here.
- **`auth_identities`** — one row per login method linked to a user. `id`, `user_id` (FK),
  `provider` (`password` | `google`), `provider_user_id` (the Google `sub`, or the user's own
  `id` for password auth), `secret_hash` (bcrypt/argon2 hash, only for `provider='password'`),
  `created_at`. Unique on `(provider, provider_user_id)`.

This split is what lets Google OAuth (§4) bolt on without a redesign, and lets a user later add
a password to an OAuth-only account or vice versa.

**Implemented** (`backend/app/models/user.py`): `User`, `AuthIdentity`, and `RefreshToken` ORM
models matching this shape, with a few concrete choices the design above left open:

- `users.id` / `auth_identities.id` / `refresh_tokens.id` are Postgres `UUID` columns with
  `server_default=gen_random_uuid()` (no extension needed on PG13+, so `pgcrypto` isn't required).
- `users.email` uses Postgres `CITEXT` for case-insensitive uniqueness, which does require the
  `citext` extension — provisioned via `database/init/001-extensions.sql`, run at DB init time
  (see §6).
- `auth_identities.provider` is constrained with a DB-level `CHECK (provider IN ('password',
  'google'))` in addition to whatever the app layer enforces, so an invalid provider value can't
  reach the table even from a bug or a manual `INSERT`.
- `refresh_tokens.ip_address` is a Postgres `INET` column rather than plain text.
- Argon2 password hashing exists (`backend/app/cli.py`), but only the `create-superuser`
  bootstrap path (§2) uses it — there's no login endpoint that verifies a password yet. JWT
  issuance and the Google OAuth flow itself are not implemented — only the schema these depend
  on exists so far.
- The `roles`/`permissions`/`role_permissions`/`user_roles` (§3) and `audit_log` (§5) tables are
  also now built as models (`app/models/rbac.py`, `app/models/audit.py`) — see §5 for the
  specifics. `orders`/`order_items` are not built yet, pending plan refinement (§5). RBAC
  *enforcement* (the `require_permission` dependency, §3) is not built either.

### Password handling

- Hash with **argon2** (via `argon2-cffi` / `passlib[argon2]`) — memory-hard, the current
  recommended default for new systems (bcrypt is an acceptable fallback if a dependency issue
  rules argon2 out).
- Password reset and email verification use short-lived, single-use signed tokens (JWT or random
  token + hash stored in a `verification_tokens` table with an `expires_at`), delivered by email.

### Sessions and tokens

Given the "unknown number of users, possibly millions" target, **avoid server-side session
storage as the primary mechanism** — it becomes a shared-state bottleneck across horizontally
scaled API instances. Instead:

- **Access token**: short-lived JWT (10–15 min), signed (RS256 so verification doesn't require
  hitting the DB or a shared secret store from every instance), carries `sub` (user id) and a
  cached snapshot of role/permission claims (§3) to avoid a permissions query on every request.
- **Refresh token**: long-lived (e.g. 30 days), opaque random value, stored **hashed** in a
  `refresh_tokens` table (`user_id`, `token_hash`, `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, `user_agent`,
  `ip_address`). Rotated on every use (old one revoked, new one issued) so a stolen refresh
  token has a limited window and reuse is detectable.
- This means logout / "sign out all devices" / admin-forced revocation all just delete or mark
  rows in `refresh_tokens` — no server-side session store needed for the hot path.

### Account states

`pending_verification` → `active` → `disabled` (admin action) — enforced as a check in the auth
dependency, not scattered across endpoints.

---

## 2. Superuser / root

**No shared "root" login.** A superuser is a normal `users` row with `is_superuser = true`.
Reasons:

- Every privileged action is attributable to a real person in the audit log (§5) — a shared root
  credential makes that impossible.
- `is_superuser` is checked as a bypass *before* the RBAC permission lookup (§3) — superusers
  don't need explicit role/permission rows, which keeps the "break glass" path simple and hard
  to accidentally lock out.

Bootstrapping the first superuser:

- A one-off CLI command (`python -m app.cli create-superuser --email ... `) run at deploy time,
  reading the initial password (or nothing, if the first login will be via Google) from an
  environment variable or secret manager — **never** a seeded row with a fixed default password
  committed to a migration.
- Recommend MFA (TOTP) be **mandatory** for any account with `is_superuser = true`, enforced at
  login, given the blast radius of that credential.
- Superuser actions (role grants, user disable/enable, impersonation) are written to the
  `audit_log` table (§5) with actor, action, target, and timestamp.

**Implemented** (`backend/app/cli.py`, tested in `backend/tests/test_cli.py`):
`python -m app.cli create-superuser [--email <email>]`.

- **Email.** `--email` is validated with a deliberately loose plausibility check (rejects a
  missing `@`, stray whitespace, a bare hostname) — not full RFC 5322 — so an obvious typo
  doesn't become a permanent `users` row no one can log into. If `--email` is omitted, the
  command prompts for it interactively and re-prompts until the value passes that check; when
  there's no terminal (CI / deploy automation) the flag is required and its absence is a usage
  error.
- **Password source, in precedence order:** `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, then `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD_FILE`
  (a path — mirroring the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` convention and the
  staging/prod Docker secret in §6), then — only at a terminal — an interactive prompt that
  asks twice and re-prompts on a mismatch. A value from the env var or the file is stripped; a
  prompted value is used verbatim apart from the blank check. A set-but-blank env var or an
  unreadable / non-UTF-8 secret file is a hard error, not a silent fallback.
- **Google-only bootstrap.** A blank password at the prompt — or, in non-interactive automation,
  leaving both env vars unset — creates the account with **no `password` `auth_identities`
  row**. First login then goes through the Google flow, which links a `google` identity to the
  existing row by verified email (§4).
- **Password identity.** When a password is supplied it's hashed with **argon2**
  (`argon2.PasswordHasher`, matching §1's "Password handling") and written to `auth_identities`
  as `provider='password'`, `provider_user_id = users.id`.
- **Idempotent, sequential.** With no matching account the command inserts one
  (`is_superuser=true`, `email_verified=true` — the operator is trusted to have verified the
  address out of band); with a matching account it promotes that row in place
  (`is_superuser=true`) and, if a password was supplied, creates or updates (rotates) its
  `password` identity. Safe to re-run (e.g. on every deploy). It is **not** safe to run
  concurrently for the same not-yet-existing email — both invocations would insert and the loser
  hits the `users.email` unique constraint.

Not yet built / open decisions:

- **MFA (TOTP)** for superuser accounts — still design-only (open question 2).
- The **promotion path** flips only `is_superuser`; it does not set `email_verified` on an
  existing (possibly unverified) row, and it trusts whatever row matches the email. Once a login
  layer exists that gates on `email_verified` or on account state (§1 "Account states"), decide
  whether promotion should also verify the address and whether it should refuse a disabled
  account.
- The prompted password has **no strength or length floor** beyond "not blank". Consider a
  minimum length with a re-prompt, given this is the one credential that bypasses RBAC.
- **Audit logging** of the bootstrap action — the command prints what it did but writes no
  `audit_log` row (there's no actor yet at bootstrap time).

---

## 3. RBAC

### Schema

- **`roles`** (`id`, `name` unique, `description`) — e.g. `user`, `admin`.
- **`permissions`** (`id`, `resource`, `action`, unique on the pair) — e.g. `orders:read`,
  `orders:write`, `users:manage`, `roles:manage`.
- **`role_permissions`** (`role_id`, `permission_id`) — many-to-many.
- **`user_roles`** (`user_id`, `role_id`) — many-to-many, so a user can hold more than one role.

Default roles to ship with:

| Role | Intent |
|---|---|
| `user` | CRUD on their own orders/items only |
| `admin` | manage users and roles within the system |
| *(implicit)* `superuser` | `is_superuser=true` bypasses RBAC entirely — not a row in `roles` |

**Implemented** (`backend/app/models/rbac.py`): `Role`, `Permission`, `RolePermission`,
`UserRole` matching this schema exactly — `role_permissions`/`user_roles` use composite primary
keys (`(role_id, permission_id)` / `(user_id, role_id)`) rather than a surrogate `id`, since
they're pure join tables. No default rows (`user`/`admin`) are seeded yet, and nothing reads these
tables — that's the `require_permission` dependency below, not yet written.

### Enforcement

- A FastAPI dependency, e.g. `Depends(require_permission("orders:write"))`, checks the JWT's
  cached permission claims first (fast path, no DB hit); falls back to a DB lookup only when
  claims are stale or absent (e.g. right after a role change, before the next token refresh).
- **RBAC answers "can this role do this kind of thing"; it does not answer "on this specific
  row."** Every business table (`orders`, `order_items`) carries an `owner_user_id`, and every
  query that isn't an admin/superuser action filters on it server-side — the client never
  supplies whose data to return. This ownership check is a second, separate gate from RBAC and
  both must pass.
- Start with hand-rolled permission checks against the tables above — it's a handful of tables
  and one dependency function. Reach for a policy engine (Casbin, Oso) only if authorization
  rules grow more relational than "own it or don't" (e.g. sharing an order with another user,
  team/org-scoped roles) — not needed for the current scope.

---

## 4. OAuth with Google

- Use **Authlib** rather than hand-rolling the OAuth2/OIDC flow — it handles PKCE, state/CSRF
  validation, and ID-token verification correctly.
- Standard Authorization Code + PKCE flow:
  1. `GET /auth/google/login` → redirect to Google's consent screen.
  2. `GET /auth/google/callback` → exchange code for tokens, verify the ID token signature and
     `email_verified` claim, extract `sub` (Google's stable user id — **never key off email**,
     which can change) and profile fields.
  3. Look up `auth_identities` by `(provider='google', provider_user_id=sub)`.
     - Match → log in as that user.
     - No match, but `email` matches an existing `users` row with a verified email → link a new
       `auth_identities` row to that user (only because Google's `email_verified` claim can be
       trusted; never auto-link on an unverified email).
     - No match at all → create a new `users` row + `auth_identities` row.
  4. Issue the app's own access/refresh token pair (§1) — downstream code never needs to know
     whether the user logged in with a password or Google.
- Secrets (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`) come from environment variables backed by
  GCP Secret Manager or AWS Secrets Manager in deployed environments — never committed, never in
  a plain `.env` outside local dev (already `.gitignore`d per `backend/.gitignore`).

---

## 5. Database design

Postgres, accessed via SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM, migrations via Alembic (autogenerate + manual
review, applied as an explicit pre-deploy step or init job — **not** on every app-instance
startup, to avoid concurrent-migration races when multiple replicas boot at once).

### Core tables

The `users`/`auth_identities`/`refresh_tokens`/`roles`/`permissions`/`role_permissions`/
`user_roles`/`audit_log` tables below are SQLAlchemy models
(`backend/app/models/{user,rbac,audit}.py`) with a generated migration
(`alembic/versions/0e452124ee78_add_uac_tables.py`) — schema is done; the RBAC-enforcement *code*
that uses these tables is not (§3). `orders`/`order_items` are intentionally **not yet
implemented** — that part of the schema needs its plan refined before implementation (open
questions: import-time dedup key, whether `order_number` is unique per-user or globally, final
shape of `tracking_numbers`) — so they're listed below as design-only, matching everything else
in §5 that predates this session's work.

```
users              id (uuid, gen_random_uuid()), email (citext, unique), display_name,
                   avatar_url, is_active, email_verified, is_superuser,
                   created_at, updated_at, last_login_at

auth_identities    id (uuid), user_id FK (cascade), provider (check: 'password'|'google'),
                   provider_user_id, secret_hash, created_at
                   — unique(provider, provider_user_id)

refresh_tokens     id (uuid), user_id FK (cascade), token_hash (unique), expires_at,
                   revoked_at, user_agent, ip_address (inet), created_at

roles              id (uuid), name (unique), description
permissions        id (uuid), resource, action              — unique(resource, action)
role_permissions   role_id FK (cascade, composite PK), permission_id FK (cascade, composite PK)
user_roles         user_id FK (cascade, composite PK), role_id FK (cascade, composite PK)

orders             id, user_id FK (indexed), order_number, order_date,       -- design only,
                   subtotal, savings, tax, tip, order_total, fulfillment,       plan not final
                   tracking_numbers, created_at                                (see below)

order_items        id, order_id FK (indexed), product_name, generic_name,   -- design only
                   quantity, price, delivery_status, product_link

audit_log          id (uuid), actor_user_id FK (set null, indexed), action, target_type,
                   target_id, metadata (jsonb, mapped as `metadata_`), created_at
```

### Notes

- Every user-owned table gets `user_id`/`order_id` FKs with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and the owning
  user id is always derived from the authenticated session server-side, never trusted from the
  client — this is the multi-tenancy boundary.
- Indexes: `users.email`, `orders.user_id`, `orders(user_id, order_date)` for time-range queries,
  `order_items.order_id`.
- `audit_log.metadata` as JSONB keeps it flexible for different action types without a schema
  migration per new admin action.
- `Base.metadata` (`backend/app/db.py`) sets an explicit Alembic naming convention (`ix_`, `uq_`,
  `uq_%(table_name)s_%(column_0_name)s`, `ck_`, `fk_`, `pk_` patterns) so autogenerate produces
  stable, deterministic constraint/index names instead of DB-assigned ones, which differ across
  dialects and can't be reliably referenced from a migration's `downgrade()`.
- The `citext` extension required by `users.email` (above) is provisioned by
  `database/init/001-extensions.sql`, baked into the custom Postgres image (§6) and applied once
  at first container init — not run per-migration.
- Two Alembic revisions exist: `be408b09e448_baseline_no_models_yet` (empty baseline) and
  `0e452124ee78_add_uac_tables` (the eight built tables above — everything except `orders`/
  `order_items`, which are pending plan refinement). `upgrade head` / `downgrade -1` /
  `upgrade head` were exercised against the dev Postgres container and `alembic check` shows no
  drift; `backend/tests/test_models.py` additionally asserts schema shape (PK/FK/unique/check
  constraints, cascade rules, index shapes) directly against `Base.metadata`/`__table__` with no
  live DB required, for fast CI feedback.
- `AuditLog.metadata_` is deliberately misspelled relative to the DB column: SQLAlchemy's
  `Declarative` base reserves the `metadata` attribute name for the class's own `MetaData` object,
  so the Python attribute is `metadata_` while `mapped_column("metadata", JSONB)` keeps the actual
  column named `metadata`.

---

## 6. Container design

- **`backend` image** [built, `backend/Dockerfile`]: multi-stage — a `chainguard/python:latest-dev`
  builder stage (has a shell/pip) that runs `uv sync --frozen --no-dev` into a `.venv`, copied into
  a `chainguard/python:latest` (Wolfi-based, distroless) runtime stage. This supersedes the
  originally-proposed `python:3.12-slim` runtime: Chainguard's image ships no shell and no package
  manager, which shrinks attack surface further than slim but also means there's no `docker exec
  sh` for interactive debugging (swap the runtime `FROM` to the `-dev` variant locally if needed).
  Only the `:latest` tag is available without a paid Chainguard subscription, and it floats, so the
  Dockerfile builds and tags its own image rather than depending on the upstream tag directly.
  `ENTRYPOINT` is reset to `[]` (Chainguard bakes in `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/python"]`, which would
  otherwise swallow `CMD`). The `HEALTHCHECK` against `/health` lives in docker-compose (§7) rather
  than the Dockerfile itself. Alembic migrations are copied into the image but **not** run on
  container start, per the no-concurrent-migration-races rule below — apply them explicitly
  (`docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head`).
- **`database` image** [built, `database/Dockerfile`]: same Chainguard/Wolfi rationale as the
  backend image, applied to Postgres (`chainguard/postgres:latest`) instead of the stock
  `postgres:<version>` image assumed implicitly above. Init SQL (`database/init/*.sql`, currently
  just the `citext` extension needed by `users.email`, §5) is baked into the image at
  `/var/lib/postgres/initdb/` — Chainguard's entrypoint reads from that path, not the
  `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` path the official postgres image uses — and only runs against a
  freshly-initialized (empty) `PGDATA`. Alpine's official `postgres:<version>-alpine` is the
  documented fallback if a needed extension is ever missing from Wolfi.
- **`worker` image** [not yet built]: same codebase/base image as `backend`, different entrypoint —
  processes background jobs (CSV import parsing, email sending) off a queue, so a large upload
  never blocks a request-handling process. Keeping the same base image avoids dependency drift
  between the two.
- **`frontend`** [not yet built]: the Angular production build (`npm run build`) served as static
  files — **not** through a Python container. Locally/on a single server, Nginx serves the built
  assets; in the cloud, they go to object storage + CDN (§7) since static assets don't need compute.
- Config exclusively via environment variables (12-factor) — `backend`'s `Settings`
  (`app/config.py`) reads a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` path mirroring the `database` image's own
  Docker-secret convention, so the same code path handles a plain env var locally and a mounted
  secret in staging/prod (§7) unchanged; no secrets baked into images. Images aren't yet tagged by
  git SHA — compose currently builds and tags them `:local`.

---

## 7. Container orchestration — docker-compose and cloud

**Important framing:** docker-compose and "GCP or AWS" aren't two orchestrators for the same
target — compose is for **local dev and the single-server deployment path**; the cloud path uses
the cloud provider's own container runtime (Cloud Run / ECS), which doesn't consume a compose
file directly. Both paths build from the *same* Dockerfiles, which is the actual portability win.

### docker-compose (local dev + single server)

**Built**, as a base file + per-environment overlay rather than one monolithic file:
`docker-compose.yml` defines the `db` and `backend` services (build context, healthchecks, the
shared `shopping-analysis` network) and is never run alone; `docker-compose.dev.yml` /
`docker-compose.staging.yml` / `docker-compose.prod.yml` layer environment-specific config on top
via `-f`:

- **dev**: plain password via `.env.dev`, Postgres port published to the host for local
  `psql`/DBeaver access, source-mounted `backend/app` + `backend/alembic` with `uvicorn --reload`,
  disposable volume. `start.sh` at the repo root wraps
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` as the one-command dev
  entrypoint.
- **staging**: mirrors prod's secret handling (Docker secret file, not a plain env var) and network
  isolation — no host port on `db`, so it's only reachable from other containers.
- **prod**: same secret-file pattern as staging, `restart: always`, and explicit CPU/memory
  `deploy.resources` limits+reservations; `backend` still exposes port 8000 as this is the
  single-server path (no separate reverse proxy container yet — see below).

**Not yet built**: a `worker` service, `redis` (job queue + refresh-token/rate-limit cache), a
`frontend` service (Nginx serving the built static bundle), and a reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy)
doing automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt. Today's compose stack is DB + API only.

### Cloud path — GCP (recommended) vs AWS

| Concern | GCP | AWS |
|---|---|---|
| Backend/worker compute | Cloud Run (scale-to-zero, pay-per-request) | ECS Fargate (or EKS for k8s parity) |
| Database | Cloud SQL for Postgres | RDS for Postgres |
| Cache/queue | Memorystore (Redis) | ElastiCache (Redis) |
| Load balancing | Cloud Load Balancing | ALB |
| Registry | Artifact Registry | ECR |
| CI | Cloud Build / GitHub Actions | CodeBuild / GitHub Actions |
| Frontend static hosting | Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN | S3 + CloudFront |

**Recommendation: start on GCP with Cloud Run.** It scales to zero (fits "unknown number of
users" — no cost while idle, no capacity planning up front) and scales up to handle bursty or
high traffic without managing a Kubernetes cluster or fixed instance fleet. AWS ECS Fargate is
the equivalent fallback if there's existing AWS infra, credits, or team familiarity — the
Dockerfiles and app code don't change either way, only the deployment manifests (Cloud Run
service YAML / Terraform vs. ECS task definitions).

---

## 8. Single server and cloud deployment

### Single server (MVP / cost-sensitive start)

A single VPS running `docker-compose up`, Caddy/Traefik for automatic HTTPS, Postgres and Redis
as containers with persistent volumes, `pg_dump` on a cron for backups. Cheap, simple, entirely
adequate until real traffic shows up — matches "unknown number of users" by not over-building
before there's evidence of scale.

### Cloud deployment

Stateless backend/worker containers on Cloud Run (or ECS Fargate) behind a managed load
balancer/autoscaler, managed Postgres (read replicas added only once query load justifies it),
managed Redis, CI/CD (GitHub Actions) building images on merge, pushing to the registry, and
deploying via `gcloud run deploy` / `aws ecs update-service` with rolling or blue/green releases.

### The migration path between them

Both environments run the *same* container images — that's the point of containerizing in the
first place. What changes between "single server" and "cloud" is only the orchestrator/config
(a compose file vs. a cloud service definition) and where Postgres/Redis live (containers with a
volume vs. managed services). This is also the deployment-side answer to the earlier
"database-agnostic" goal: SQLAlchemy makes the *database engine* swappable; containerizing makes
the *deployment environment* swappable — together they mean starting cheap on one VPS doesn't
lock the project out of moving to Cloud Run/ECS later without a rewrite.

---

## Open questions for review

1. GCP vs AWS as the committed cloud target (recommendation: GCP/Cloud Run, above) — or keep
   both live as a genuine requirement rather than a fallback?
2. MFA for superuser accounts: mandatory at launch, or phased in after basic auth ships?
3. Job queue choice for the `worker` image — Celery (mature, heavier) vs RQ (simpler, Redis-only)?
4. Do we need org/team-scoped sharing of order data in the medium term? It doesn't change §1–3
   much now, but affects whether RBAC roles should be scoped per-resource sooner rather than later.
5. `orders`/`order_items` schema (§5) needs its plan refined before implementation: what's the
   import-time dedup key for a re-uploaded CSV (order number alone, or order number + retailer)?
   Is `order_number` unique per-user or globally, given different retailers can reuse the same
   numbering scheme? What's the final shape of `tracking_numbers` — a Postgres array, a JSONB list,
   or a separate `order_shipments` table if a single order can ship in multiple packages with
   different carriers?
6. `create-superuser` promotion semantics (§2), to settle when the login layer lands: should
   promoting an existing account also set `email_verified = true`, and should it refuse a
   `disabled` account rather than silently re-enabling privileges? Should the interactive
   password prompt enforce a minimum length?
